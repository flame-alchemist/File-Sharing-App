SETUP GUIDE:

1) Set the IP address in the client.py to that of your server system. (Change port number if needed)
2) Make changes in the file name of both the server.py and client.py (WHEREVER MENTIONED IN THE CODE) according to your main system and what you desire. 


INSTALLATION and EXECUTION GUIDE:

1) Use 3 system in which 2 acts as a client (sender and receiver) and 1 as server.
2) Execute 'server.py' on the server system. (NOTE: Run on python2. Ex- python2 server.py)
3) Execute 'client.py' on both the client system. (python2 client.py)
4) Make one client system as SENDER and another as RECEIVER by selecting the appropriate choice given after execution of code. (NOTE: The first system to be connected to the server must be sender followed by receiver)
5) Once the sender system is connected, specify the pathname of the file/image that has to be transferred. (NOTE: The code as been harcoded for JPG file only. Changes can be made in the code for transferring different file formats by altering the path names)
6) Your file would have been transferred to the desired path in the receiver system.
